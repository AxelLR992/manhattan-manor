                to 18 years, you can browse the Sites but youâll need the supervision
                of a parent or guardian to become a registered user. Itâs the
                responsibility of parents or guardians to monitor their childrenâs use

                </strong>1.
                If you make your personal information available to other people, we
                canât control or accept responsibility for the way they will use or
                manage that data. There are lots of ways that you can find yourself
                providing information to other people, like when you post a public
                message on a forum thread, share information via social media, or make
                contact with another user (such as a third party Author) whether via our
                Sites or directly via email. Before making your information publicly
                available or giving your information to anyone else, think carefully. If
                giving information to another user via our Sites, ask them how they
                will handle your information. If youâre sharing information via another

                that we erase your personal information and close your Manhattan Manor
                account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal

                accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br><strong>When we need to update this policy</strong><br>1.
                We will need to change this policy from time to time in order to make

                If youâre a user or visitor in the European Economic Area these rights also apply to you:
                <br>
                For
                the purposes of applicable EU data protection law (including the
                General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the âGDPRâ), we are a âdata
                controllerâ of your personal information.<br><br><strong>How you can access your personal information<br>
                </strong>1.
                You are also entitled to ask us to port your personal information (i.e.
                to transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format,
                to you), to erase it, or restrict its processing. You also have rights
                to object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests,
                such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing,
                and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to
                withdraw this consent as more fully described below.<br><br>
                2.
                These rights are limited in some situations â for example, we can
                demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal
                information. In some instances, this means that we may retain some data
                even if you withdraw your consent.<br><br>
                3.
                Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or
                contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if
                such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our
                contractual relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us.
                In all other cases, provision of requested personal information is
                optional.<br><br>
                4.
                If you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to
                data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will
                be the data protection authority of the country: (i) of your habitual
                residence; (ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider
                the alleged infringement has occurred.<br><br>
