Website built on top of [PHP](https://www.php.net/) for Manhattan Manor.

## Description

This repository contains the frontend and backend of the website. It uses some basic technologies to build a simple but beautiful website:

- PHP.
- HTML.
- CSS.
- JavaScript.

## Installation

Download and install in your computer the next software:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Apache WebServer](https://httpd.apache.org/).
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
- [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/).

You can make it easier for you just downloading **[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html)**.

Then, make a copy of the file `/app_includes/psl-config.example.php` and rename it to `/app_includes/psl-config.php`, and fill it with your database credentials.

The next step is to include the project in your Apache WebServer configuration and start it.

## Deployment

This application requires a web host that supports PHP. The only step is to upload it to the `public_html` folder of the host, or the folder with the subdomain name if it applies.
